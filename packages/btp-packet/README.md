# CLP Packet
> Codec for Common Ledger Protocol messages

This implements the encoding for the CLP protocol as defined [in the latest pull request](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/263). The encoding is all there, but some TODOs remain before it can be considered complete. Timestamp encoding and 64-bit integer handling need more work. CLP does not yet have a first draft either, so this is a WIP.
